Capstone Project - Turtle Crossing Game

In the upcoming lessons, we have created step-by-step instructions to help you complete this project.

- Difficulty Normal ðŸ˜Ž: Use all Steps to complete the project.
- Difficulty Hard ðŸ¤”: Use only Steps 1 and 2 to complete the project.
- Difficulty Expert ðŸ¤¯: Only use Step 1 to complete the project.

As with the previous Capstone, I will do this with "Expert" Difficulty

Provided starting files creates an empty Class for the classes we will need and setups a 600x600 screen

Gameplay:

1. A turtle moves forwards when you press the "Up" key. It can only move forwards, not back, left or right.
2. Cars are randomly generated along the y-axis and will move from the right edge of the screen to the left edge.
3. When the turtle hits the top edge of the screen, it moves back to the original position and the player levels up. On the next level, the car speed increases.
4. When the turtle collides with a car, it's game over and everything stops.
