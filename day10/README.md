## Exercises

- Days in Month: get input from user and create a function to return days in month. Use a seperate function to determine if it is a leap year and adjust Feb. accordingly

## Final Challenge

- Calculator - build a calculator...I added a few things in here (mostly error handling) that are beyond the scope of what has been currently taught
