# Day 16

Today we start OOP

So far we have been doing procedural programming, where code is mostly executed top down, and one procedure leads into another.

## Challenge

re-implement coffee maker using OOP the following files were provided and not modified:

- coffee_maker.py
- menu.py
- money_machine.py

all code for challenge written in main.py

I feel there is a bug in the "money_machine.py" provided file. money recieved is not reset to 0 after change is provided... I have addressed this in my main.py but this really should be done in the class method
