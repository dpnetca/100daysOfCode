# Day 6

Today's instruction added in functions and while loops. We put these top practice using [Reeborgs World](http://reeborg.ca)

## Excercises

The excercises today included jumping over hurdles of of increasing complexity (see hurdle1.py -> hurdle4.py)

## Final Challenge

Today's final challenge was the maze, which was solved in maze.py. However there is a corner case where this solution fails, seen by loading in the problenm_world JSONs. Additional testing added to "problem_worlds.py" so solve the maze and address this problem.
