# Network Flow

Creating a simple network diagram and animating some packet flow using Turtle

Made a comment in study group about creating a network packet flow as a joke....then got tempted to see if I could make something work....it's rudementary but it works..

note this isn't replicating any real data, it continuously generates packets of random colors, when they hit the middle router they are randomly routed either up or down
