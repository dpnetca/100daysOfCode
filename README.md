# 100 Days of Code
I first heard about the 100 Days of Code concept sometime in the last year or two, and it has intrigued me.
So this year, along with several fellow members of the [Router Gods](http://routergods.com) user group, I am
doing the 100 days of Code book camp following this particular Udemy Course: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

I intend to use this Repo to track my progress.

## repl.it
for the first few days of lessons (possibly the first 15 days?) we are using repl.it for our code. 
I may move these to this repo at some point, but repl.it is neat as it allows you to run the code in the browser.
You can see my repl.it profile at: https://repl.it/@dpnetca there are are lots items in here related to the 
100 days of code course as I follow along with the lessons.
Below are links to the specific repls for the end of day projects:
 - Day 1: [Band Name Generator](https://repl.it/@dpnetca/band-name-generator-start#main.py)
 - Day 2: [Tip Calculator](https://repl.it/@dpnetca/tip-calculator-start#main.py)
 - Day 3: [Treasure Island](https://repl.it/@dpnetca/treasure-island-start#main.py)


## Cadence
As a group we have initially decided on a slightly slower cadence, to allow as many people as we can to be able
to join along, and recognizing that everyone has busy schedules, our goal is to complete 4 days worth of sessions
per week, then have time on Sunday's for open discussion.  To this end I also wrote a little script to quickly
create our target calendar: [cadenace](https://repl.it/@dpnetca/cadence#main.py)

However, I do plan, initially atleast, to try and do a little bit each day, and average out to 1 days lesson per day.
I expect some days I will complete more then 1 lesson, some days I will complete none, but I hope to maintain this
average.  Work / Life / Learn balance is important though, and at times this will mean the training needs to pause
for other priorities (i.e. spending timne with my spouse and my puppers, going on vacation (if we can ever travel again?),
Cisco DevNet certifications, etc). In the spirit of 100 days of code however, I will be making efforts to do some coding every day,
even if it is not in line with this course.  This will include code related to DevNet studies, or automating all the things
at work :).

With a Start date of January 1, 2021, following the 4 days/week cadence we have a group goal to bve complete by teh end of June.
However, if I/we can do the 100 days in 100 days, we should be complete by mid April....Here we go...
